This is a class project for CS 410 Data Engineering, Winter 2021.

This week we learned how to work with a publish-subscribe pattern using Apache Kafka, Confluent, and a Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) virtual machine build on Google Cloud Platform. We used several tutorials which supplied code to get started so we could experiment with the data stream between Kafka Producer and Consumer objects within a Kafka Topic.
